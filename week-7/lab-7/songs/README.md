# In this lab, my task was to write SQL queries that can answer questions about a database of songs.

## I've wrote SQL queries to answer these questions below:

```
1. In 1.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all songs in the database.
 - Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.

2. In 2.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all songs in increasing order of tempo.
 - Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.

3. In 3.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of the top 5 longest songs, in descending order of length.
 - Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.

4. In 4.sql, write a SQL query that lists the names of any songs that have danceability, energy, and valence greater than 0.75.
 - Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.

5. In 5.sql, write a SQL query that returns the average energy of all the songs.
 - Your query should output a table with a single column and a single row containing the average energy.

6. In 6.sql, write a SQL query that lists the names of songs that are by Post Malone.
 - Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.
 - You should not make any assumptions about what Post Malone’s artist_id is.

7. In 7.sql, write a SQL query that returns the average energy of songs that are by Drake.
 - Your query should output a table with a single column and a single row containing the average energy.
 - You should not make any assumptions about what Drake’s artist_id is.

8. In 8.sql, write a SQL query that lists the names of the songs that feature other artists.
 - Songs that feature other artists will include “feat.” in the name of the song.
 - Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.

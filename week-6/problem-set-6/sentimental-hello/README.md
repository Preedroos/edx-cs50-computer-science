# In this program, I wrote a program that prompts a user for their name, and then prints `hello, so-and-so`, where `so-and-so` is their provided name.

## I've implemented a program that prints out a simple greeting to the user, per the below.

```
$ python hello.py
What is your name?
Pedro
hello, Pedro
```

# In Credit, my task was to take a credit card number and determine whether that number is an American Express credit card number, a MasterCard number, a Visa number or maybe, something else entirely.

## I've implemented a program that determines whether a provided credit card number is valid according to Luhnâ€™s algorithm.

```
$ python credit.py
Number: 378282246310005
AMEX
```

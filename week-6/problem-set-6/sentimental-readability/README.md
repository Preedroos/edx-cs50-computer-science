# In Readability, my task was to write a program in Python that can take some text and assess the approximate reading level of that text.

## I've implemented a program that computes the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text, per the below.

```
$ python readability.py
Text: Congratulations! Today is your day. You're off to Great Places! You're off and away!
Grade 3
```

# In Mario, my task was to re-implement some pyramids from the game Super Mario Brothers in code in a Python program.

* *The program we’ll write will be called mario. And let’s allow the user to decide just how tall the pyramids should be by first prompting them for a positive integer between, say, 1 and 8, inclusive.*

## Here’s how the program might work if the user inputs 4 when prompted:

```
$ python mario.py
Height: 4
   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####
```

# In Substitution, my task was to implement a substitution cipher where you can encrypt or encipher some plain text by taking every alphabetic character in that plain text and replacing it with another character.

## For this problem, I wrote a program that implements a substitution cipher, per the below.

```
$ ./substitution JTREKYAVOGDXPSNCUIZLFBMWHQ
plaintext:  HELLO
ciphertext: VKXXN
```

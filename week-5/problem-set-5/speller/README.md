# In Speller, my task was to write a spell checker that can take a text and take every word in that text and check to see if the word is spelled correctly or not and, importantly, to do so as quickly as possible.

## For this problem, I've implemented a program that spell-checks a file, per the below, using a hash table.

```
$ ./speller texts/lalaland.txt
MISSPELLED WORDS

[...]
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT
[...]
Shangri
[...]
fianc
[...]
Sebastian's
[...]

WORDS MISSPELLED:
WORDS IN DICTIONARY:
WORDS IN TEXT:
TIME IN load:
TIME IN check:
TIME IN size:
TIME IN unload:
TIME IN TOTAL:
```

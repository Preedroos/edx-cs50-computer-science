# In this lab, my task was to write a program in C that simulates the inheritance of blood type genes within a family.

## It simulates the inheritance of blood types for each member of a family.

```
$ ./inheritance
Child (Generation 0): blood type OO
    Parent (Generation 1): blood type AO
        Grandparent (Generation 2): blood type OA
        Grandparent (Generation 2): blood type BO
    Parent (Generation 1): blood type OB
        Grandparent (Generation 2): blood type AO
        Grandparent (Generation 2): blood type BO
```

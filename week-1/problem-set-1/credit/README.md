# In Credit, my task was to take a credit card number and determine whether that number is an American Express credit card number, a MasterCard number, a Visa number or maybe, something else entirely.

## Consider the below representative of how this program should behave when passed a valid credit card number (sans hyphens).

```
$ ./credit
Number: 4003600000000014
VISA
```

## Otherwise:

```
$ ./credit
Number: 6176292929
INVALID
```

# In Plurality, my task was to write a program that simulates an election. The program take a sequence of votes as input, and it outputs the winner of that election.

## For this program, I've implemented a program that runs a plurality election, per the below.

```
$ ./plurality Alice Bob Charlie
Number of voters: 4
Vote: Alice
Vote: Bob
Vote: Charlie
Vote: Alice
Alice
```
